# QBL Token Overview

## What is the QBL Token?

The QBL token is the cryptocurrency that powers the Quible Network. This page explains what QBL is and how it can be used.

## Uses

- **Network Payments**: When an author desires to create or update an identity on the Quible Network, they pay in QBL to the nodes that successfully execute their transactions within the blockchain.

- **Bridge Payments**: When an author desires to relay their identity information from another chain (usually an NFT on an EVM chain), they pay in QBL to reserve usage of the bridge. Each time the bridge successfully relays identity information to Quible, the bridge receives a reward from the authorâ€™s designated reserve. Without paying to reserve a bridge, your identity information will not be relayed to Quible.

- **Blockchain Rewards**: Validator Node operators and Signer-Validator Node operators are also rewarded with QBL for performing useful tasks on the network. QBL is used to reward operators who validate and add new blocks to the blockchain. Validator Nodes receive a block reward in QBL for each new block they add to the blockchain and also earn transaction fees in QBL for processing the transactions for that block. Validator-Signer Nodes receive a reward multiplier in exchange for participating in MPC signing for the network.
